> in this project i have created a table named animal inside my vet_clinic database and my table containe I then inserted the elements into my database using the INSERT INTO method which I followed each colon according to the values I was attrubing. For the boolean it returns tru or false and for the others it contains the value. 
I then chose from my table the elements that end with name, the animals that were born in the space 2016 to 2019 and the animals that weigh between 10.4 and 17.3KG. 


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
